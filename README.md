## Run Directus
In order to get this project running, we need to run Directus locally, which can be achieved using the following steps (which can also be found in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CmGyQEBnb7CIaA16ljhtLEb96m8SfZKIyZqypAGVB4g/edit?usp=sharing)):
1. Download Docker
2. Download [this repository](https://github.com/areejnaqvi-tlx/directus.git) to your desktop in a folder named 'directus'
3. cd into this new directus folder and tun the command `docker compose up`
4. Your Directus instance is now running on localhost:8055. Login details are in the docker-compose file in your directus folder.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
